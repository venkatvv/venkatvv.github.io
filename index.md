## About Me
I entered college without any prospective majors in mind. When I took my first class in Computer Science I found a passion for the subject immediately. I was also really drawn in the by the range and diversity of jobs available in the field.  

There are multiple areas in the field that I am interested in 
They include: 
- Game development
- Mobile application development
- Web development
- Software development
- Database systems/management etc.
