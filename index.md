## About Me
My name is Venkat and I am a senior at the University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, and I am currently finishing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

I entered college without any prospective majors in mind. When I took my first class in Computer Science I found a passion for the subject immediately. I was also really drawn in the by the range and diversity of jobs available in the field and all their possible applications.  

There are multiple areas in the field that I am currently interested in. They include:

- Game development
- Mobile application development
- Web development
- Software development
- Database systems/management etc.
