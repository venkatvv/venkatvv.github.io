# Agent O'Hare
Where the Light Doesn’t Touch is a single-player puzzle game created by a team of four (including me) at Game Jam Winter 2017 competition at the University of Michigan. The Game Jam is an event in which programmers, artists, and designers group up into groups of three or four and create a game within 48 hours. Game Jam Winter 2017 was the biggest turnouts in the last 5 years and Agent O'Hare managed to win first place amidst heavy competition!

In the game, the protagonist must kill the lion king, who resides somewhere on every level. The movement of the game is tile-based, and it is also turn based. The enemies will only move after the player moves, if they have the ability to move/turn. 

The game also utilizes a “spotlight” type of vision. This vision can be obstructed by natural obstacles such as rocks and grass, but will not be hindered by water. The map begins as an unknown territory that is revealed as the player continues to explore it.

We wanted to keep the game as simple as possible, and so the entire game can be played with the arrow keys/WASD movement. To maintain the player’s interest, a large variety of enemies were implemented, some of which are birds that can fly, sentry giraffes that can alert other enemies of your whereabouts, and moles that can teleport. The difficulty of the game gradually increases as the player clears more levels. 

This game is currently available at for play at:
